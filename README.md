# Dataset used = Kaggle dataset 1429_1.csv: Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products
The Dataset contains details about various types of products sold by amazon e.g
Kindle, Fire HD, Fire TV etc.

# Data collection and processing:
- Scrapping amazon product reviews
- Cleaning and formating the data for analysis

# Implementation steps
- Importing the necessary python packages
- Loading the dataset
- Tokenisation
- Applying sentiment analysis techniques to calulate the polarity and similarity scores of the reviews
- Assign vectors to words

# Results and Interpretation
The polarity is a float value between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a negative
sentiment, 0 indicates a neutral sentiment, and 1 indicates a positive sentiment.

The similarity score is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an objective
statement and 1 indicates a subjective statement.

These values allow us to see which products or categories have the highest or lowest
customer satisfaction and identify any outliers or trends that may indicate customer
preferences or issues.
